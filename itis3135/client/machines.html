        <h2>Machines</h2>
        <p>Short, entry-level descriptions of the Tier 1 (Starting Point) machines so you can choose which to try next.
        </p>
        <p>NOTE: Although most machines are marked as easy or very easy, they are actually very hard for a beginner. Be patient.</p>

        <h3 id="appointment">Appointment</h3>
        <h4>Difficulty: Very Easy | OS: Linux</h4>
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Appointment is designed to teach basic service enumeration and simple foothold
            techniques. Expect an approachable, guided flow ideal for first-time machine users.</p>
        <p><strong>Skills practiced:</strong> basic network scanning, service probing, reading simple config/files.</p>
        <p><strong>Why pick it:</strong> Very beginner-friendly and a gentle introduction to the HTB workflow.</p>

        <h3 id="sequel">Sequel</h3>
        <h4>Difficulty: Very Easy | OS: Linux</h4>
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Sequel focuses on straightforward reconnaissance and following obvious leads from
            discovered services to gain access.</p>
        <p><strong>Skills practiced:</strong> web and service enumeration, interpreting banners and version info.</p>
        <p><strong>Why pick it:</strong> Great for practicing a methodical scan → enumerate → exploit cycle without
            complex pivots.</p>

        <h3 id="crocodile">Crocodile</h3>
        <h4>Difficulty: Very Easy | OS: Linux</h4>
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Crocodile introduces simple web and file-discovery techniques that lead to a clear
            foothold.</p>
        <p><strong>Skills practiced:</strong> directory discovery, file analysis, using discovered artifacts to
            progress.</p>
        <p><strong>Why pick it:</strong> Teaches essential web enumeration habits and reading clues left in files.</p>

        <h3 id="ignition">Ignition</h3>
        <h4>Difficulty: Very Easy | OS: Linux</h4>
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Ignition is aimed at teaching straightforward vulnerability discovery and safe
            verification of exploits.</p>
        <p><strong>Skills practiced:</strong> targeted scanning, manual verification of potential issues, cautious
            exploitation.</p>
        <p><strong>Why pick it:</strong> Good next step for learners who want to practice validating findings safely.
        </p>

        <h3 id="pennyworth">Pennyworth</h3>
        <h4>Difficulty: Very Easy | OS: Linux</h4>
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Pennyworth emphasizes following a small chain of clues—from an exposed service to
            useful information that leads to a shell.</p>
        <p><strong>Skills practiced:</strong> service interaction, credential discovery, initial foothold techniques.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Why pick it:</strong> Encourages careful enumeration and correlating small pieces of information into
            a working attack path.</p>

        <h3 id="tactics">Tactics</h3>
        <h4>Difficulty: Very Easy | OS: Linux</h4>
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Tactics teaches basic problem-solving on simple services and configurations;
            expect clear, teachable steps.</p>
        <p><strong>Skills practiced:</strong> reconnaissance, interpreting service responses, basic privilege escalation
            checks.</p>
        <p><strong>Why pick it:</strong> Excellent for reinforcing the methodology you learned on earlier Starting Point
            boxes.</p>

        <h3 id="next-steps">Next steps</h3>
        <p>When you finish these Tier 1 machines you can progress to higher Starting Point tiers or explore other Easy
            machines on HTB. If you want, I can swap any of these summaries for deeper notes or link to specific
            walkthroughs (kept spoiler-free).</p>
