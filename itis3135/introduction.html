        <p>
            I’m currently pursuing a career in cybersecurity. I went to Central Piedmont Community College and attained my 
            Associate’s Degree in May 2025. I’ve come to UNCC so that I can get a Bachelor’s in Computer Science. In my spare time, 
            I mostly just watch YouTube, go hiking from time to time, and attempt to grow my skillset so that I can eventually become 
            a cybersecurity professional.
        </p>

        <p>I was born and raised in Waxhaw, NC. I’ve lived around this area my whole life.</p>

        <h2>Professional Background</h2>
        <p>I’ve worked in wildly different positions. For a time, I did steel fabrication.</p>

        <h2>Academic Background</h2>
        <p>
            Currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, completed Associate in Arts at CPCC.

        <h2>Courses I’m Taking & Why</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>ITIS-3200: Because it is very relevant to the field I wish to enter</li>
            <li>ITIS-3135: Because I am decent at back-end programming, but not front-end</li>
            <li>ITSC-2600: Because it’s required for my degree and concentration</li>
            <li>ITSC-3688: Because I need to improve my soft skills</li>
            <li>MATH-1242: Because my degree requires it (to my great dissatisfaction)</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember Me By</h2>
        <p>I love playing any Halo game that was made before 2010 (CE, 2, 3, ODST, Reach).</p>
