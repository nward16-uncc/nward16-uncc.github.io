    <h1>Nathaniel D. Ward | Nuclear Whale</h1>

    <p>I’m currently pursuing a career in cybersecurity. I went to Central Piedmont Community College and attained my 
        Associate’s Degree in May 2025. I’ve come to UNCC so that I can get a Bachelor’s in Computer Science. In my spare time, 
        I mostly just watch YouTube, go hiking from time to time, and attempt to grow my skillset so that I can eventually become 
        a cybersecurity professional.
    </p>

  <h2>Courses I’m Taking & Why</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>ITIS-3200:</strong> Because it is very relevant to the field I wish to enter</li>
    <li><strong>ITIS-3135:</strong> Because I am decent at back-end programming, but not front-end</li>
    <li><strong>ITSC-2600:</strong> Because it’s required for my degree and concentration</li>
    <li><strong>ITSC-3688:</strong> Because I need to improve my soft skills</li>
    <li><strong>MATH-1242:</strong> Because my degree requires it (to my great dissatisfaction)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember Me By</h2>
