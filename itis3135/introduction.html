        <p>
            I’m currently pursuing a career in cybersecurity. I went to Central Piedmont Community College and attained my 
            Associate’s Degree in May 2025. I’ve come to UNCC so that I can get a Bachelor’s in Computer Science. In my spare time, 
            I mostly just watch YouTube, go hiking from time to time, and attempt to grow my skillset so that I can eventually become 
            a cybersecurity professional.

            <li>ITSC-2600: Because it’s required for my degree and concentration</li>
            <li>ITSC-3688: Because I need to improve my soft skills</li>
            <li>MATH-1242: Because my degree requires it (to my great dissatisfaction)</li>
