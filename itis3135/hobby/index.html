                <h2>What Is Cybersecurity?</h2>
                <p>
                    Many people have heard the term "cybersecurity" used before, 
                    but they aren't quite sure what it means.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting data, devices, 
                    networks, and people from potential cyber threats.
                </p>

                    My name is Nathaniel Ward. I'm a student at UNC Charlotte majoring in 
                    Computer Science with a concentration in cybersecurity.

                <p>
                    Ever since I had access to a computer, I enjoyed diving into its internals
                    to figure out how they work exactly and how I can make them do something that 
                    they weren't intended to do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am always doing my best to engage in this hobby in the most ethical way possible. 
                    Working with potentially destructive programs requires many precautions that must 
                    be taken, and I am sure to always take them.

                    The beauty of this hobby is that you can generally practice anytime of the year and anytime

                            I tried a few different prompts before deciding on this one. I think it helped that 
                            Def Con is so popular, so the data set contained a large number of Def Con photos.

                    single board computer called a Raspberry Pi that functions as a small server.

                <p>
                    On top of that, I have created virtual machines and networks so that I can simulate real world

                <p>
                    I enjoy cybersecurity because it's so complex and you can dive down a rabbit hole that seemingly 
                    never ends. It feels like you are unraveling a mystery and it's very satisfying when you figure 
                    it out after expending lots of time & effort.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've always had a very focused interest in computers in general, so learning how they work and 
                    how to make them behave in different ways is very enjoyable to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenging hobbies always seem to have the biggest "payoff" in my mind. To me, a hobby isn't about 
                    relaxing or unwinding, it's about the thrill of completing the challenge.

                            on the wall is something I can relate to when I'm trying my best to figure out a CTF challenge. It helps keep
