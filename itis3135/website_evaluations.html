                <h3><a href="https://thefwa.com" target="_blank">The FWA (Favorite Website Awards)</a></h3>
                <p>The FWA is an award site that showcases innovative and experimental websites from designers and developers around the world. It balances creativity with usability, making it a strong example of an artsy site that still respects design principles.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The site uses bold typography, vibrant imagery, and high contrast between text and backgrounds to highlight featured projects.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Project previews follow a consistent card format, reinforcing a unified browsing experience across the site.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Despite featuring experimental designs, the site itself stays aligned to a grid structure that keeps navigation clean and logical.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Each projectâ€™s visuals, title, and designer credits are grouped together, making it easy for users to connect content with its creator.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><a href="http://www.zombo.com" target="_blank">Zombo.com</a></h3>
                <p>Zombo.com is an intentionally absurd website. It features almost no content, just looping audio and a simple animated home page. It has become a classic example of poor design.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Minimal contrast, especially on the animation, with bland colors that fail to emphasize any important elements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> There is almost no repetition or consistency, since the entire site is basically one looping screen.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> No meaningful layout exists; the elements appear randomly centered with no design structure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> With so little actual content, there is no clear grouping of information or logical organization.</li>
                </ul>
